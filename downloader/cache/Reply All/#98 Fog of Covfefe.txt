ALEX GOLDMAN: YOU ARE GETTING OWNED SO HARD BY ALEX BLUMBERG RIGHT NOW.
PJ: THIS IS NOT WHAT I COME TO THIS SEGMENT FOR (LAUGHING). YEAH, THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE. ANYWAY, THE THING THAT HAPPENED THE NEXT DAY WAS LIKE--
ALEX GOLDMAN: IT WAS LIKE CINDERELLA HAD TURNED BACK INTO A PUMPKIN.

ALEX BLUMBERG: UH HUH.
ALEX GOLDMAN: IN FACT, I WOKE UP, HAVING NOT BEEN AWAKE FOR THE THING--FOR THE ORIGINAL TWEET JUST BEING LIKE, “WHAT ARE ALL THESE UG--WHAT ARE ALL THESE ROTTEN PUMPKINS STREWN ABOUT TWITTER?” (LAUGHING) “THIS JOKE IS BAD!”
ALEX BLUMBERG: UH HUH.

ALEX BLUMBERG: OH...
PJ: YEAH. DO YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING?
ALEX BLUMBERG: THE GUH--THE JOKE KILLER IN CHIEF.
PJ: YES. UM.
ALEX GOLDMAN: UH, HERE. SO UH THE DAY AFTER COVFEFE FEVER DONALD TRUMP TWEETED -- MADE A TOTALLY UNRELATED TWEET THAT SAID, "CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON NOW BLAMES EVERYBODY BUT HERSELF, REFUSES TO SAY SHE WAS A TERRIBLE CANDIDATE, HITS FACEBOOK AND EVEN DEMS AND DNC."
PJ: AND SO, SHE RESPONDS PROBABLY 12 HOURS AFTER THIS JOKE IS LIKE FULLY, FULLY, FULLY DEAD AND SHE SAYS: "PEOPLE IN COVFEFE HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW COVFEFE." AND SHE QUOTE TWEETS HIM. AND IT GETS 306,000 RETWEETS.
AB: YEAH...
ALEX GOLDMAN: SHE DIDN'T DO A GREAT JOB WITH THE JOKE. IT'S KIND OF--SHE JUST KIND OF REPLACED A COUPLE WORDS WITH A GIBBERISH WORD.
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING) YES.
PJ: AND IT'S JUST LIKE--THAT FEELING OF LIKE, “OH GOD. THE THING WE HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH FOR LIKE A YEAR, OF LIKE DONALD TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING WILD AND UNINTELLIGIBLE. HILLARY CLINTON LIKE, MAKES A JOKE ABOUT IT THAT'S NOT VERY FUNNY.” AND IT WAS LIKE, AT LEAST LIKE THE ELECTION WAS SUPPOSED TO END THAT. AND SO IT WAS JUST LIKE--
ALEX BLUMBERG: MHM.
PJ: IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING.
ALEX GOLDMAN: THERE'S ACTUALLY LIKE A WHOLE OTHER FACET TO THIS STORY WHICH WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT, WHICH IS WHILE YOU WERE ROLLING YOUR EYES AT HILLARY CLINTON'S LAME JOKE, THE TRUMP INTERNET SAW COVFEFE AS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SO, THERE IS THIS IDEA AMONG SORT OF ARDENT INTERNET TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES HE'S ALWAYS--HE'S ALWAYS LIKE, SEVERAL--SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD OF PEOPLE, AND HE'S ACTUALLY MUCH SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY GIVES HIM CREDIT FOR.
PJ: HE'S A CHESS MASTER.
ALEX GOLDMAN: YEAH. HE'S PLAYING WHAT THEY CALL TEN-DIMENSIONAL CHESS. SO, EVERYBODY JUST RIGHTLY JUST AGREED THAT COVFEFE WAS A TYPO, EXCEPT FOR THE TRUMP...
PJ: LIKE THE SUPER DIEHARD--
ALEX GOLDMAN: 4--4CHAN THE DONALD SUBREDDIT PEOPLE... THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT A TYPO.
PJ: REALLY?
ALEX GOLDMAN: THAT IT WAS DELIBERATE. AND--

ALEX BLUMBERG: SPACE. 
ALEX GOLDMAN: SPACE. F-E-APOSTROPHE-F-E. OK. WHAT DOES IT SAY?
ALEX BLUMBERG: OH. IT SAYS UH--OH, APPARENTLY THAT'S AN ARABIC WORD--OR AN ARABIC SENTENCE THAT SAYS, "I WILL STAND UP.”
ALEX GOLDMAN: SO, UH, IF--
 
IF YOU BELIEVE THE TEN-DIMENSIONAL CHESS VERSION OF DONALD TRUMP--
PJ: (WHISPERING) THIS IS INSANE.
ALEX GOLDMAN: WHAT HE SAID WAS, "DESPITE NEGATIVE PRESS, I WILL STAND UP." UM. NOW, A BUNCH OF ARABIC LINGUISTS HAVE SAID: THAT'S A TERRIBLE, UH, TRANSLATION, NO ONE SPEAKS LIKE THAT.
PJ: BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW?
ALEX BLUMBERG: RIGHT.
ALEX GOLDMAN: BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW?
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING)
ALEX GOLDMAN: UH, DONALD TRUMP WAS--WAS DOING SOME TEN-DIMENSIONAL CHESS.
ALEX BLUMBERG: NATIVE ARAB SPEAKERS.
PJ: (LAUGHING) THAT IS SO FUNNY!
ALEX GOLDMAN: ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
PJ: OH MAN. SO, IF WE RETURN TO OUR ORIGINAL TWEET, UH … ALEX, ARE YOU AT A POINT WHERE YOU COULD TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS?
ALEX BLUMBERG: YES! UGH.
PJ: (LAUGHS)
ALEX BLUMBERG: THIS MIGHT BE THE HARDEST RECAP YET.
PJ: (LAUGHING) THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TOUGH ONES.
ALEX BLUMBERG: I KNOW. BUT NOT LIKE, INCEPTION LEVEL.
ALEX GOLDMAN: [INCEPTION VOICE] UUUUHHHHHHHH...
ALEX BLUMBERG: THANK YOU. UH...
PJ: OH GOD. (LAUGHING)
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING) I'M GONNA MAKE IT SO YOU CAN'T EDIT IT OUT.
PJ: (LAUGHING) I HAVE SO MUCH HATRED IN MY HEART! JUST LIKE WATCHING LIKE A RUNNING JOKE GET FORCED IN.
ALEX GOLDMAN/ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING)
ALEX BLUMBERG: ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ONE MORE CALL BACK, AND THEN IT'LL BE FUNNY.
PJ: (LAUGHING) I HATE THIS SO MUCH...!
ALEX BLUMBERG: ONE MORE. IT'LL BE FUNNY. UHHHH … OK. UH...ALRIGHT. OK, SO: DOLLARS HORTON. ONCE AGAIN, THE TWEET IS: "FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW," AND THEN HE IS QUOTING A FAKE TWEET FROM HILLARY CLINTON, THAT SAYS, THE ONLY KERPLAPPY THAT COVFEFES IN THESE GELPSFSSAAAÆ5 ARE THE MILLIONS DEAD! SPONGEBOB FACE.” AND THEN, THAT FAKE HILLARY CLINTON QUOTE INCLUDES A FAKE DONALD TRUMP QUOTE THAT SAYS, "THE MEDIA INGORES MY VERY SINCERE KERPLAPY TO AUSTRALIA, NO ONE WILL REPORT NUCLEAR MISSILES CREATE JOBS." JOBS IS ALL CAPITALIZED.
ALEX GOLDMAN: ALRIGHT. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, ALEX BLUMBERG?
ALEX BLUMBERG: UH, ALRIGHT. SO WHAT THIS MEANS--IT ALL GOES BACK TO A TWEET THAT DONALD TRUMP SENT OUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, OR ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO. IN WHICH HE SAID, "DESPITE THE MEDIA COVFEFE" AND THEN JUST STOPPED. AND THEN TWELVE HOURS AFTER THAT, IN WALTZES HILLARY CLINTON WITH A-WITH A--WITH A TWEET THAT HAD A BAD JOKE IN IT. 
PJ: MHM.
ALEX BLUMBERG: SO THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL EVENT. AND THAT WAS--SO THAT WAS SORT OF--THAT WAS THE WHOLE COVFEFE CYCLE. AND NOW, SO DOLLARS HORTON IN THIS TWEET IS IMAGINING THE COVFEFE CYCLE JUST, SORT OF LIKE, CONTINUING ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS, AND IN THIS IMAGINED FUTURE, FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW, DONALD TRUMP (LAUGHING) HAS ACCIDENTALLY NUCLEAR BOMBED AUSTRALIA...
PJ: (LAUGHING)
ALEX BLUMBERG: WHICH IF IT REALLY HAPPENED, I WOULDN'T BE LAUGHING AT. JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS. UH… HE'S ACCIDENTALLY NUCLEAR BOMBED AUSTRALIA. FOLLOWED BY A TWEET IN WHICH HE SAYS (LAUGHING), WHICH IS REALLY A FUNNY SCENARIO. I MEAN IT'S NOT A FUNNY SCENARIO...
PJ: (LAUGHING)
ALEX BLUMBERG: BUT THE--THE, IMAGINE THIS TWEET OF LIKE, IF I ACCIDENTALLY BOMBED AUSTRALIA, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD BE TWEETING. BUT IT--IN THE--IN THIS IMAGINED FUTURE IN WHICH HE ACCIDENTALLY BOMBED AUSTRALIA, WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HE--HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO TWEET THE FOLLOWING: "THE MEDIA INGORES MY SINCERE KERPLAPPY TO AUSTRALIA. NO ONE WILL REPORT NUCLEAR MISSILES CREATE JOBS." SO THAT WAS, LIKE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A VERY--I FEEL LIKE A VERY EFFECTIVE, UM, UH SATIRE OF A DONALD TRUMP--TRUMP TWEET.
PJ: MHM.
ALEX BLUMBERG: AND THEN, HILLARY CLINTON, ALSO IN A VERY EFFECTIVE SATIRE, HAS… SORT OF GONE COMPLETELY OFF THE RAILS IN THIS IMAGINED FUTURE, AND IS JUST SORT OF LIKE, JUMPING ON IN ALL SORTS OF CONFUSED AND JANGLED WAYS, AND TRYING TO, LIKE, POKE FUN AND ALSO POINT OUT HOW ACTUALLY HORRIBLE IT IS TO ACCIDENTALLY NUCLEAR BOMB A COUNTRY, IN A CONFUSED SORT OF MUDDLED WAY THAT RESULTS IN THIS TWEET: "THE ONLY KERPLAPPY THAT COVFEFES IN THESE GELPSFSSAAAÆ5 ARE THE MILLIONS DEAD!

IF MY ACTIONS OFFENDED YOU, I'M SINCERELY SO--SORRY. ALIENATING A PORTION OF MY AUDIENCE IS STUPID AND UNNECESSARY. DIFFERENT OPINIONS ARE GOOD. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THOSE OPINIONS ARE VALUABLE. I'LL DO MY BEST TO PUT THE TRAIN BACK ON THE TRACKS TO THE WHOLESOME, PURE, ESCAPE FROM REALITY ACCOUNT YOU ALL HAVE COME TO LOVE.” IN A NOTE THAT HE TITLED “REGARDING THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT.”
ALEX BLUMBERG: AW.
PJ: SO THEN, PEOPLE WERE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY WERE LIKE,”HOW DARE YOU! YOU DON'T STAND WITH WOMEN! YOU DON'T STAND WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS!” THE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE WERE MAD BECAUSE HE MADE IT ABOUT ABORTION. THE PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE WERE MAD BECAUSE HE MADE IT ABOUT ABORTION, AND THEN LIKE FLINCHED WHEN PEOPLE GOT ANGRY. LIKE, IT WAS LIKE--IT WAS SO CRA--LIKE, I NEVER… IT WAS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL--
ALEX BLUMBERG: AND ALL HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS MAKE A BUCK OFF A MEME.
PJ: YES!
ALEX BLUMBERG: WOW!
ALEX GOLDMAN: THE OTHER THING IS THAT--IT--IT REALLY (LAUGHS) IT REALLY DEMONSTRATED TO ME, HOW LIKE, WE REALLY CAN'T ENJOY ANYTHING WITHOUT IT TURNING INTO A POLITICAL FIGHT.
ALEX BLUMBERG: I KNOW. LIKE, THE ENTIRE INTERNET IS LIKE...THANKSGIVING WITH THE IN-LAWS. ALRIGHT  SO NOW I THINK I GOT IT. I THINK IT'S--I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A RECAP.
PJ: ALRIGHT, LET'S GO BACK TO THE TWEET.
ALEX BLUMBERG: THE TWEET IS, FROM GREGORY CAT-BOTHERER: “THE @DOG_RATES ACCOUNT WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING, QUOTE: ‘DOGGOS THINK SWEATSHOPS ARE HECKING BAD’ AND VOWS TO BE NEUTRAL ABOUT SWEATSHOPS.” UM. SO THIS IS A TWEET THAT IS IN, UH… IN THE WAKE OF WHAT I NOW KNOW TO BE THE DOG_RATES CONTROVERSY. UM AND I WOULD SAY, THIS IS COMING FROM THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF THINGS.
ALEX GOLDMAN: YES.
PJ: MHM.
ALEX BLUMBERG: WHERE HE'S LIKE… HE'S MAD AT DOG_RATES FOR GOING BACK ON HIS LIKE PROGRESSIVE STANCE. UM AND SORT OF LIKE IMAGINING A WORLD IN WHICH, UH, INSTEAD OF TWEETING ABOUT… ABORTION, HE TWEETED ABOUT SWEATSHOPS.
PJ: MHM, MHM.
ALEX BLUMBERG: AND SAYING “SWEATSHOPS ARE BAD” AND NOW IN IMAGINING A WORLD IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN SORT OF CONSERVATIVE BACKLASH AGAINST THE ANTI-SWEATSHOP TWEET, AND NOW HE'S SAYING THAT HE'S GONNA BE NEUTRAL ABOUT SWEATSHOPS.
ALEX GOLDMAN: WE'RE AT YES YES YES.
ALEX BLUMBERG: WE'RE AT YES YES YES.
PJ: ALRIGHT
PJ : HELLO HELLO. 
ALEX BLUMBERG: ALRIGHT. 
PJ: OKAY SORRY LET ME JUST GET MY BEARINGS. OKAY SO THAT LAST CONVERSATION WE HAD WAS ON MONDAY IT’S NOW WEDNESDAY. I HAVE A SMALL BUT EXCITING UPDATE ABOUT DOG RATES BUT ALSO THERE’S THIS THING I’VE BEEN REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TELLING YOU GUYS THAT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU. 
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT BUT ALEX I DON’T THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
ALEX BLUMBERG: MHM. 
PJ: SO I FEEL LIKE WE ACTUALLY 
THERE'S BEEN LIKE A COUPLE YES YES NOS WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT LIKE, KEN BONE, OR LIKE, WHATEVER, THAT THERE'S LIKE A--THERE'S A THING THAT HAPPENS WHERE THE INTERNET REALLY LOVES SOMEBODY AND THEY WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM UNTIL THEY FIND THE THING THEY DON'T LIKE AND THEN THEY HATE THE PERSON AS QUICKLY WITH THE SAME FORCE. AND THERE'S LIKE, I DIDN’T--THERE'S A WORD FOR THAT, WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW.
ALEX GOLDMAN: OH YEAH. GREAT SHORTHAND.
PJ: SO, UH--MILKSHAKE DUCK? SO, THERE'S THIS VIRAL TWEET BY THIS ACCOUNT PIXELATED BOAT, THAT JUST SAYS, (LAUGHS) “THE WHOLE INTERNET LOVES MILKSHAKE DUCK, A LOVELY DUCK THAT DRINKS MILKSHAKES!” FIVE SECONDS LATER: “WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT THE DUCK IS RACIST.”
ALEX BLUMBERG: UH HUH (LAUGHING).
ALEX GOLDMAN: SO, PE--PEOPLE--PEOPLE BE--RAPIDLY BECOME MILKSHAKE DUCKS.
PJ: YEAH. SO YOU'D BE LIKE, "OH" AND I THINK HE DID LIKE KIND OF LIKE A RARE LIKE DOUBLE MILKSHAKE DUCK, LIKE HE LIKE, MILKSHAKE DUCKED HIMSELF TO THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF THE INTERNET, THEN HE MILKSHAKE DUCKED HIMSELF TO THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF THE INTERNET.
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING)
PJ: LIKE, IT WAS LIKE, USUALLY YOU JUST DO ONE.
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING) RIGHT. YOU DON'T DOUBLE DOWN.
PJ: (LAUGHS) YEAH. SO I WANTED TO TALK TO THE GUY WHO DID THIS SO I CALLED DOG_RATES YESTERDAY. 
ALEX BLUMBERG: (LAUGHING) OK.
ALEX GOLDMAN: REALLY?
PJ:  YEAH HE’S A TOTALLY NICE GUY HIS NAME IS MATT NELSON.
MATT NELSON: HELLO?
PJ: HEY, MATT?
MATT: YES. HOW ARE YOU? 
PJ: HEY, THIS IS PJ. HOW’S IT GOIN?
MATT: GOOD. EXCITING SLASH SCARY LAST 72 HOURS-ISH?
PJ: SO I DON'T KNOW WHO I WAS PICTURING WOULD THE WERATEDOGS™ ACCOUNT BUT IT DEFINITELY WASN’T MAT LIKE HE’S A COLLEGE SOPHOMORE AND HIS WHOLE MOTIVATION FOR DOING THIS THING IT’S NOT REALLY MONEY IT’S HE JUST HAS A VERY PURE LOVE OF THE FEELING OF WRITING A FUNNY TWEET AND LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKING IT. LIKE I THINK HIS MOTIVATION IS BASICALLY HE’S LIKE A CLASS CLOWN FOR THE INTERNET. SO IT’S BEEN REALLY WEIRD FOR MATT TO SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE HIS TWEETS HAVE GOTTEN HIM IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF WHAT FEELS LIKE TO HIM A NATIONAL SCANDAL. 
MATT: SO THE NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE HAS NOW MADE THREE OR FOUR ARTICLES ON THIS NOW 
PJ: REALLY 
MATT: WHICH IS YEAH. OK. IAN TUTTLE HAS MADE TWO. HE HIMSELF HAS WRITTEN TWO FULL LENGTH ARTICLES ABOUT THE WERATEDOGS™ COVEFE INCIDENT THAT TO ME LIKE WHAAT? 
PJ: SO PART OF WHY THIS IS SO CONFUSING FOR MATT IS BECAUSE THIS WASN’T LIKE HIS FIRST POLITICAL POST, LIKE HE’S DONE A BUNCH SINCE THE ELECTION EVERY TIME HE DID ‘EM MOSTLY PEOPLE LIKED EM AND IF SOMEONE GOT MAD MATT WOULD JUST DO YOU KNOW THE INTERNET JIUJITSU STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, HE’D MANAGE THE SITUATION IT WOULD TURN OUT FINE AND LIKE IT JUST WOULDN’T BE A PROBLEM. LIKE FOR INSTANCE HE TALKED ABOUT THIS POST HE DID BACK IN JANUARY AFTER THE WOMEN’S MARCH OF THIS DOG WITH A SIGN THAT SAID I MARCH FOR MY MOMS. 
MATT: AND THEN SOMEONE RESPONDED I DON'T LIKE TO SEE THIS ON MY TIMELINE," JUST UH--AND I SAID, "THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN'T IGNORE RIGHT NOW." UM, AND THEN SOMEONE SAID, "100 PERCENT UNFOLLOWED," AND I SAID, "I 100 PERCENT DON'T GIVE A SHIT." 
PJ: (LAUGHS)
MATT: AND SO LIKE SOMEONE-SOMEONE--SOMEONE SCREENSHOTTED THAT, AND THAT WENT JUST AS VIRAL AS THE ACTUAL POST. UM, SO FROM THAT, AND LIKE WE, SO THAT WAS OUR MOST UNFOLLOWED DAY EVER, WE LIKE LOST 800 PEOPLE, BUT WE GAINED 37,000.
PJ: IN THE RIGHT.. IT SEEMS LIKE THE THING YOU HAD SORT OF IDENTIFIED LIKE THERE ARE CERTAIN ISSUES THAT ARE THAT YOU CAN BE A BIT POLITICAL AND PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT. AND THEN IF SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING MEAN TO YOU AND YOU RETORT PEOPLE WERE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE DOG RATES KIND OF LIKE HAVING A BACKBONE. 
MATT: OH ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. 
WELL FIRST OF ALL IF YOU ENTER AN ARGUMENT WITH MY AVATAR ONLINE YOU'VE ALREADY LOST. YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT
PJ: BECAUSE YOU'RE YELLING AT A PICTURE OF A CUTE DOG.
MATT: EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
[LAUGH]
ALEX GOLDMAN: BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEN WHY… THIS--HE TREATED THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION AS A TEACHABLE MOMENT WHERE HE HAD TO WALK IT BACK.
PJ: YEAH I MEAN MATT SEEMS CONFUSED BY THAT TOO, LIKE I THINK THAT HE HE DESCRIBED COVFEFE NIGHT THE SAME WAY I DID. I DO THINK A MYSTERIOUS FOG ROLLED INTO TOWN AND CLOUDED EVERYBODY'S JUDGEMENT. HE THINKS HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE AND SOME OF THAT WAS THE JOKE WASN’T EVEN FUNNY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HE KINDA KNEW THAT AND FOR HIM THE THING HE MOST REGRETTED WAS JUST THE APOLOGY. HE’S LIKE IT WASN’T IN MY VOICE IT DIDN’T SOUND LIKE ME IT CAME FROM A PLACE OF FEAR I JUST SHOULDN’T HAVE APOLOGIZED
ALEX BLUMBERG: SEE, THE THING ABOUT THE INTERNET, FOR ALL, LIKE--THE THING THAT LIKE, I FEEL LIKE, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, BUT THE THING THAT IS LIKE, IT'S REALLY ANNOYING AND IT'S LIKE CROWD, AND LIKE ALL--AND IT REACTS IN THIS CRAZY WAY, AND IT'S GOT MOB MENTALITY, BUT IT DOES-- IT IS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD AT PINPOINTING EXACTLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISINGENUOUS. AND THAT'S THE THING THAT DRIVES IT CRAZY.
PJ: YEEAAH! YEAH.
ALEX BLUMBERG: AND THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING
PJ: YEAH HE FLINCHED…. AND HE SORTA KNOWS IT… 
MATT:  I’VE ACCEPTED WITH A FOLLOWING SUCH AS MINE YOU CAN’T PLEASE EVERYONE. IN THIS CASE I TRIED TO. I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MORE MISTAKES COMING. LIKE THAT’S JUST THAT’S JUST THE NATURE OF IT THERE’S GONNA BE UHH I THINK 
 
I BELIEVE THERE WAS A PICTURE OF A DOG AND THERE WAS LIKE A PEELED BANANA IN FRONT OF HIM AND THEN SOME OTHER BANANAS. AND I SAID THAT HE UNPEELED THE BANANA. AND IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE WERE LIKE NO HE PEELED IT. AND SO I WAS LIKE OH SHIT WHAT DO I DO AND I LOOKED IT UP AND I WAS LIKE IT CAN BE EITHER WHAT. WHAT. WHAT DO I DO. UNPEELED OR PEELED. LIKE BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS I SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT.
